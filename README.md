Project to apply search algorithms for peg solitaire and klotski puzzles.

# To-do
- [x] Research search algorithm papers
- [x] Research klotski and peg solitaire papers
- [ ] Research and come up with heuristics
- [x] Code basic peg solitaire
- [x] Code basic klotski
- [x] Code two-player peg solitaire without search
- [ ] Apply different search algorithms
- [ ] Measure run time and memory usage of the search algorithms
- [ ] Repeat for harder versions of those puzzles such as two-player versions

## Peg Solitaire
- [x] Breadth first 
- [x] DFS
- [ ] Iterative deepening
- [ ] Uniform cost
- [ ] A* graph (not tree)
- [ ] Bidirectional 

Two-player
- [ ] Monte Carlo tree
- [ ] Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning

## Klotski Seach Algorithms 
- [x] Breadth first 
- [ ] Iterative deepening
- [ ] Uniform cost
- [ ] A* graph (not tree)
- [ ] Bidirectional 
- [ ] Monte Carlo tree
- [ ] Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning (for two-player)
