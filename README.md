Project to apply search algorithms for peg solitaire and klotski puzzles.

# To-do
- [ ] Research search algorithm papers
- [ ] Research klotski and peg solitaire papers
- [ ] Research and come up with heuristics
- [ ] Code basic peg solitaire
- [ ] Code basic klotski
- [ ] Apply different search algorithms
- [ ] Measure run time and memory usage of the search algorithms
- [ ] Repeat for harder versions of those puzzles such as two-player versions
